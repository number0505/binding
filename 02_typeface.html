				The Nature of Type Design in the Digital Age

					Intro
				</h3>
				<p>
					Like many disciplines dependent on technology for execution or production, type design has undergone a series of fundamental revolutions and transitions in the past century. Driven by technological advance, this process has completely changed the way people work with type, to the point where someone employed in the field had to adapt to a significantly changing situation multiple times throughout a career. At the beginning of the transition there was the 19th century hot metal typesetting with its very complex and expensive mechanised equipment invented by Monotype and Linotype. A period of opto-mechanical photocomposition systems followed in the 1950s and 60s, in which printing with cast letter-forms was replaced with exposure of optical outlines on spinning disks of glass onto light-sensitive paper. This was soon replaced again by the digital simulation of similar processes, formulated in computer programs and executed first by huge room-filling installations and later by affordable home computers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The advent of computer technology and the digital revolution had similar impacts on many other creative fields, such as graphic design, photography, film editing, or audio recording, with changes often similar in nature. Highly expensive equipment was made redundant by computer technology running software that simulates the same processes. The software and the user interfaces often use metaphors from within the field, known from the time before the revolution, and the role of the computer is that of a machine simulating other machines or processes as a sort of a meta-tool. Even today, software is largely defined as that, and therefore computers function mostly as replacements for previously existing processes, the type-writer and postal service being two of the most common examples.
				</p>
				<p>
					Democratisation is another important part of these developments. The sudden general availability of processes through computerisation has continued to increase the number of people who have access to and start engaging in them. In the creative sector, this also led to a change in the nature of the work being done, often to the disapproval of the previous specialists in the field. While type design in the 19th century was a craft accessible to very few selected typographers, who together with punchcutters worked on designs for one of the companies producing typesetting equipment, it is now a discipline that anyone who has access to a computer and a licence for a type design software can engage in.
				</p>
				<p>
					These are generally known aspects of this revolution that have been looked at closely many times before. But the role of software is rarely analysed beyond this point. It appears that the general function of the computer is still accepted simply as a simulation machine, and the question what software could or should provide in any given field is rarely raised. Instead, the status quo is often accepted as a given, a language we use in our daily work and that we have stopped questioning, since it is so ubiquitous that is it almost invisible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, in the historic discourse of digital typefaces, questions regarding the definition and nature of digital typefaces are hardly risen and the status quo is rarely questioned beyond the boundaries of the industrial standards.

					Fonts, Tools and Software
				</h3>
				<p>
					Traditionally, a font was a complete set of metal characters of a particular typeface in a given size and style. Etymologically, the word goes back to the French word fonte and the verb fondre, meaning to melt or to cast, referencing the way fonts were produced by type foundries. Fonts were one of the ingredients needed in the printing process in order to be able to print text, and they were bought in full sets from the foundries. A set included more copies of some letters than others, depending on the statistical occurrence of each letter in any given language. The structure of the letter cases that hold the letters represented this distribution. A font was not a full, independent tool in itself, but rather a part of a tool-based process which, without it could not take place. Given its physical nature at that time, it is imaginable that fonts were perceived as tools in themselves. At the same time they could also be seen as an artwork designed by a typographer and executed by a punch cutter. Today, digital fonts are legally defined as software, once again as the digital counterpart of a tool. This has broad consequences for the way fonts are distributed and sold, and the way type designers are earning their money, since licensing schemes similar to the ones found in software applications are in place: the End User License Agreements (EULA) entitle the end users of fonts to install them on a defined number of computers within the same household or office. The degree of usage of the font in this case has no impact on the price. As soon as the user has bought the license, he owns the right of usage within the defined boundaries and therefore can use the font as a tool as much as he likes, as long as he does not infringe the rules of the agreement. This might lead to absurd situations, for example when in certain circumstances a big newspaper may pay the same amount of money for a font that is printed in thousands or even millions of issues daily as a small graphic design office that uses the font once for a client’s job. Both buy the basic right to use the font as a tool for whatever they need it for, and the creative work in the typeface is unaccounted for.
				</p>
				<p>
					While there are foundries that have created complicated agreements for such special cases, the basic problem of unequal usage remains and is criticised by many type designers: the fact that the creative work is not taken into account in the definition as a tool, ignoring the fact that a typeface is also an artistic work by a creative individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					An alternative way of defining typefaces is as library or a family of graphical shapes (glyphs) along with rules that describe how to assign these to letters and symbols (character encoding), and how to adjust the space between them (letterspacing and kerning). If this definition was used legally, another system would suggest itself: one based on royalties, as in the music industry or applied photography, both fields where an artwork or a composition is licensed for specific media based distribution. The licensing costs then mostly depend on the duration of the segment, the size of the image, visibility, distribution, etc. Specific associations claim these royalties and distribute them among their members, enforcing copyright law and ensuring rights of authorship for the protected works.

					Approaches to Typefaces as Software
				</h3>
				<p>
					The process of digitalisation and computerisation of type-oriented technology is probably a never ending one since
					new innovative approaches are continuously being found for how to draw and produce type designs. Yet the most
					fundamental changes and revolutions in the field have happened, and the process of software standardisation is
					largely completed.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the beginning of this process, there was the question of how typesetting is best represented in software and
					executed or output by printing devices. With the introduction of pixel-based display technology such as CRT
					monitors, there was also the problem of how to represent glyph outlines appropriately on such low resolution devices
					and not lose the font’s main characteristics. There were many different proposals, and through a slow process of
					selection and advancement, some of them were abandoned while others merged and became standards.
				</p>
				<p>
					This exciting time of technical innovation has lead to many different efforts and resulting systems, but now at the
					end of this process of standardisation, there is primarily one system the whole industry is focused on: the
					previously mentioned OpenType, a standard coined by Microsoft together with Adobe Systems as a result of the “Type
					War” between Apple’s TrueType standard and Adobe System’s PostScript. Microsoft, who previously licensed the
					TrueType technology from Apple, decided to move ahead and create their own standard based on TrueType in the early
					1990s, after negotiations with Apple to license their advanced typography technology called “GX Typography” failed.
					Adobe Systems joined in 1996 and added support for the glyph outline descriptions based on its PostScript’s Type 1
					fonts. In 2005, OpenType started migrating to an open standard under the International Organisation for
					Standardisation (ISO) and the process was completed in 2007 when it was accepted as a free, publicly available
					standard.
				</p>
				<p>
					This system has become the standard for type on most of today’s modern operating systems such as Mac OS X, Windows
					and Linux, and most typesetting applications support its special typographic features.
				</p>
				<p>
					But there is a rather large niche in which one of the other proposals from the period of early digital type
					technology has survived until today: the typesetting system TeX (with its spin-off project LaTeX, a collection of
					macros to simplify TeX) and its font system Metafont, used mostly in academia, especially in the mathematics,
					computer science, and physics communities. Both TeX and Metafont were conceived and designed by highly acclaimed
					computer scientist Donald E. Knuth as a solution to the problem of typesetting complex mathematical formulas and
					more generally scientific publications. TeX has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographic
					systems in the world. TeX (and therefore LaTeX) have adapted to the same wider spread font standards mentioned
					above. Nevertheless Metafont is still relevant, as it is largely unknown in the domain of type design and has a
					history that is still of interest for more recent experiments in programmatic type design based on the principles of
					parametric variations.

					TeX and Metafont as an Example of Early Parametrised Digital Typesetting
				</h3>
				<p>
					As the author of the highly acclaimed monograph The Art of Computer Programming, listed by the American Scientist as
					one of the 12 best physical-science monographs of the 20th century, Donald E. Knuth was always concerned with the
					printed appearance of his works and fascinated by the technical facilities and the skills of their operators. The
					quality of the first three published volumes of his monograph, all typeset in Monotype Modern 8A on mechanical hot
					type machines from the same company, provided great satisfaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					When in 1977 due to financial restrictions the new edition of volume 2 was to be reproduced with a new optical
					typesetting system rather than the already disappearing Monotype machines, he saw his world collapse. The optical
					typesetting systems mostly used typefaces of minor quality, copied or derived from the ones carefully designed by
					typographers for Monotype and other hot metal type foundries. For Knuth the beautifully typeset texts and
					mathematical equations were not simply a nice feature to have, they were part of his motivation to actually write
					these books. Knuth was obsessed with the beauty of his printed works. In the introduction to Computer Modern
					Typefaces, the book about a family of parametrisable fonts that he developed using his Metafont system, he says he
					has “ink running through his veins.” If his works were going to be badly typeset, he decided there was no point in
					continuing to write them since the finished products were just too painful to look at. He realised he would have to
					do something about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Excited by the impending technological revolution in print that would bring digital printing at a high enough
					resolution that the pixels would not be visible to the human eye, he decided to come up with a new system that would
					correctly compose typography in pixels, independent from machines and their resolution. The little squares that
					either contain 1 or 0, to represent ink or no ink, he concluded, were part of his realm as a computer scientist, so
					he assumed he should be able to come up with a better solution rather quickly. Knuth reasoned that if solved
					properly, this work could be of use for a very long time, since this basic principle of pixels as the core component
					of digital printing would not change, no matter how much the technology surrounding it does. All this happened
					before Adobe Systems was founded and the base for the page description language PostScript was laid out. At the
					beginning of this endeavour, Knuth did not even have the possibility to see the results on screen. Each time he
					wanted to try out a change in the software he had to make digital prints on a facility without easy or regular
					access.These huge devices were very expensive to run and an acquisition only made sense for large corporations with
					continuous use.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1978 Knuth was invited to speak in the prestigious Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecture, established by the American
					Mathematical Society (AMS) in 1923 and held annually to increase public awareness of the aspects of mathematics and
					its applications. Knuth quite bravely decided that instead of speaking purely about mathematics or algorithms, his
					talk should be about this new project that at the time received all his focus, preventing him from advancing with
					other projects. In the lecture entitled “Mathematical Typography,” Knuth presented his first analysis of the
					problems of recent printing technology in the domain of mathematical publications to a large group of mathematicians
					and scientists. Studying and comparing many different examples from the “Transactions of the American Mathematical
					Society,” a publication that began in 1900 and has more than 230 volumes to date, Knuth found that they were printed
					in at least 12 different styles. Of these the quality appeared to have generally declined to an absolute low in
					recent years, at which time he decided there was no point in continuing to write for these publications anymore.
				</p>
				<p>
					Knuth then proposed solutions involving a row of computer-assisted methods of composition and layout that form the
					core of TeX, as well as what he identified as basic principles for mathematical type design. He introduced this
					territory by first looking at past proposals of typography based on mathematical and geometric constructions, such
					as the mostly geometry-based works by Felice Feliciano, Luca Pacioli, Francesco Torniello and Giovani Battista
					Palatino in Italy, as well as Geofroy Tory and later the commission of a group of artists and typographers to create
					a royal alphabet for Louis XIV in France. This historic detour was then followed by his proposal for a remedy that
					finally included some mathematical formulas to describe the characteristics of the curves he was looking for. He
					ended the talk by presenting a row of tests made with a rough, early version of Metafont, all playful and
					experimental in nature.
