								Hunting surface analogs between the printed and the digital book is a dangerous honeypot. There is a
								compulsion to believe the magic of a book lies in its surface.
							</p>
							<p>
								In reality, the book worth considering consists only of relationships. Relationships between ideas
								and
								recipients. Between writer and reader. Between readers and other readers — all as writ over time.
							</p>
	
							<p>
								The future book — the digital book — is no longer an immutable brick. It's ethereal and networked,emerging
								publicly in fits and starts. An artifact ‘complete’ for only the briefest of moments. Shifting deliberately.
								Layered with our shared marginalia. And demanding engagement with the promise of community implicit in its form.
							</p>
							<p>
								The book of the past reveals its individual experience uniquely. The book of the future reveals our
								collective experience uniquely.
							</p>
							<p>
								For those of us looking to shape the future of books and publishing, where do we begin? Simply,
								these are
								our truths:
							</p>
							<p>
								The way books are written has changed.
								The canvas for books has changed.
								The post-published life of a book has changed.
							</p>
							<p>
								To think about the future of the book is to understand the links between these changes. To think
								about the
								future of the book is to think about the future of all content. So intertwined are our words and
								images and
								platforms, that to consider individual parts of the publishing process in isolation is to miss
								transformative connections.
							</p>
							<p>
								These connections shaping books and publishing live in emergent systems behind the words. Between
								the
								writing and the publishing, publishing and consuming, consuming and sharing.
							</p>
							<p>
								We have an opportunity now to shape these systems. And in doing so, to refine the relationships
								between
								authors, publishers, readers and texts.
							</p>
							<p>
								What tools will we embed within digital artifacts to signal this shifting relationship with
								literature?
								To surface our shared experience?
								To bridge the raw pre- and post- artifact spaces that so define the future of publishing?
								<strong>build the future book?</strong>

								Books are systems. 
							</p>
							<p>
								They emerge from systems. They themselves are systems — the best of which are as complex as is necessary, and not one bit more. And once complete, new systems develop around their content.
							</p>
							<p>
								To understand where books and publishing are moving, it is critical to understand the following three systems: 
							</p>
							<ul class="square">
								<li>
									the pre-artifact system
								</li>
								<li>
									the system of the artifact
								</li>
								<li>
									the post-artifact system
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								The pre-artifact system is where the book or story or article is made. It’s a system full of (and fueled by) whiskey, self-doubt, confusion, debauchery and a general sense of hopelessness. Traditionally, it’s been a system of isolation, involving very few people. The key individuals within the classic manifestation of this system are the author and the editor. A publisher, perhaps. A muse. But generally, not the reader. The end product of this system is what we usually define as ‘the book’ — the Idea made tangible.
							</p>
							<section class="quote">
								<blockquote>
									"A system of isolation, involving very few people."
								</blockquote>
							</section>
							<p>
								The artifact — the book — too, is a system. Traditionally, an island unto itself. Immutable. A system self-contained. One requiring great efforts to extend beyond the binding. When finished, it becomes a souvenir of a private journey.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, the post-artifact system. This is the space in which we engage the artifact. Again, traditionally a relatively static space. Isolated. Friends can gather to discuss the artifact. Localized classes can be constructed in universities around the artifact. But, generally, there is an overwhelming sense of disconnection from the other systems.
							</p>
							<p>
								Digital changes this.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most fundamentally digital removes isolation. Removes it from the pre-, artifact, and post- systems. The corollaries: an increase in connectivity. Mutability of artifact. Continuous engagement with readers. And most excitingly, a potentially public record of change, comment, discussion — digital marginalia — layered atop the artifact, adding to the artifact, and redefining ‘complete.’
							</p>
							<p>
								With the connection of these systems, our classic definition of a literary artifact no longer applies. And our common understanding of publishing systems is irrevocably disrupted.

								With the emergence and growing adoption of the Kindle and the iPad, publishers, writers, readers and software-makers have concerned themselves with shoehorning the old-media image of a book into new media. Everyone asks, ‘How do we change books to read them digitally?’ But the more interesting question is, ‘How does digital change books?’ And, similarly, ‘How does digital change the authorship process?’				
							</p>
							<p>
								With digital impermanence (a new kind of ephemerality) comes two concepts key to the future of storytelling and books:
							</p>
							<ul class="decimal">
								<li>
									We can continuously develop a text in realtime, erasing the preciousness imbued by printing. And because of this ...
								</li>
								<li>
									Time itself becomes an active ingredient in authorship (in contrast to authorship happening in a seemingly timeless place, a finished product suddenly emerging).								
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Wikipedia is a fully realized example of how digital drastically affects authorship. By creating a system that allows collective edits in real-time, Wikipedia has embedded iterative writing into its foundation. Nothing on that site is precious. No letter, word, sentence or article is immune to reconsideration. And yet, by tracking changes on a micro scale, they’ve built trust around a continuously evolving system.
							</p>							
							<p>
								Consider the physical analog to Wikipedia — the encyclopedia set. In the early naughts, it would have been difficult to imagine that a website written and edited by hundreds of thousands of people, constantly mutating, could have possibly formed the replacement for that dusty set of leather bound books on your bookshelf. And yet, not only has Wikipedia replaced the physical encyclopedia for many of us, but it’s surpassed it in usefulness, quality, timeliness and perhaps most significantly, convenience. The core editorial ethos of the physical encyclopedia still informs Wikipedia, but the ways in which content is created, shared, and edited are born from digital.
							</p>
							<div class="strong">
								Take a set of encyclopedias and ask, “How do I make this digital?” You get a Microsoft Encarta CD. Take the philosophy of encyclopedia-making and ask, “How does digital change our engagement with this?” You get Wikipedia.							
							</div>
							<p>
								When we think about digital’s effect on storytelling, we tend to grasp for the lowest hanging imaginative fruits. The common cliche is that digital will ‘bring stories to life.’ Words will move. Pictures become movies. Narratives will be choose-your-own-adventure. While digital does make all of this possible, these are the changes of least radical importance brought about by digitization of text. These are the answers to the question, “How do we change books to make them digital?” The essence of digital’s effect on publishing requires a subtle shift towards the query: “How does digital change books?”
